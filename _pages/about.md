<b>About Me</b>

I am now a first-year <a href='https://ml.gatech.edu/'>Machine Learning</a> Ph.D. student at <a href='https://www.gatech.edu/'>Georgia Institute of Technology</a>, supervised by Professor <a href='https://yongxin.ae.gatech.edu/'>Yongxin Chen</a>. Previously, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in statistics from the <a href='http://www.math.pku.edu.cn/'>School of Mathematical Sciences</a>, <a href='https://www.pku.edu.cn/'>Peking University</a> in 2023, where I was mentored by Professor <a href='https://zcrabbit.github.io/'>Cheng Zhang</a>. I am born in <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ningbo/'>Ningbo</a>, Zhejiang Province, China in 2001.

<b>Academic Interests</b>

I am broadly interested in fields ranging from statistics, probability, and machine learning. 

<p><strong>Statistics</strong>: Bayesian Inference, Computational Statistics, Optimization, Sampling (Markov Chain Monte Carlo).</p>

<p><strong>Probability</strong>: Optimal Transport and Gradient Flow Theory, Applied Stochastic Analysis, High-dimensional Probability.</p>

<p><strong>Machine Learning</strong>: Deep Generative Modeling, Machine Learning Theory.</p>

The focus and goal of my research are two-fold: to reveal the fundamental principles behind the success of data-driven algorithms and to use these insights to develop accessible, efficient, and robust approaches for solving real-world problems that are essential and valuable for our society.

I am also interested in <i>la langue fran√ßaise</i> (the French language), vernaculars of Chinese and minority languages in China, <a href="https://www.openrailwaymap.org/">China's railway system</a>, <a href="https://www.flightradar24.com/">aviation</a>, and video games (especially action games such as <i>The Last of Us</i> and <i>Assassin's Creed</i>). I am an enthusiast of traveling.
