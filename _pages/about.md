<strong>🔥About Me</strong>

I am a <a href='https://ml.gatech.edu/'>Machine Learning</a> Ph.D. student at <a href='https://www.gatech.edu/'>Georgia Institute of Technology</a> starting from fall 2023, advised by Professors <a href='https://yongxin.ae.gatech.edu/'>Yongxin Chen</a> and <a href='https://mtao8.math.gatech.edu/index.html'>Molei Tao</a>.
Previously, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Statistics from the <a href='http://www.math.pku.edu.cn/'>School of Mathematical Sciences</a>, <a href='https://www.pku.edu.cn/'>Peking University</a> in 2023, where I was mentored by Professor <a href='https://zcrabbit.github.io/'>Cheng Zhang</a>.
I was born in <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ningbo/'>Ningbo</a>, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhejiang'>Zhejiang Province</a>, P.R. China in 2001, and grew up there until I left for Beijing in 2019.

<strong>🔥 Academic Interests</strong>

I am broadly interested in fields ranging from statistics, probability, and machine learning. My current research interests include but are not limited to:

<strong>➡️ Statistics and Probability</strong>: Theoretical analysis and practical design of sampling algorithms (Markov chain Monte Carlo, non-equilibrium, or learning-based neural samplers); Applied stochastic analysis with applications to optimal transport, stochastic optimal control, and statistical physics.

<strong>➡️ Machine Learning</strong>: Generative modeling, with a particular focus on (continuous/discrete) diffusion and flow-based models and with applications to vision, language, and sciences.

<strong>🔥 Other Interests</strong>

I am also interested in languages (including: <i>la langue française</i> (the French language), vernaculars of Chinese and minority languages in China, and linguistics), political science, <a href="https://www.openrailwaymap.org/">China's railway system</a>, <a href="https://www.flightradar24.com/">civil aviation</a>, architecture, and video games (in particular, action games such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us"><i>The Last of Us</i></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin%27s_Creed"><i>Assassin's Creed</i></a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_(franchise)"><i>Метро (Metro)</i></a> series).
I am a fan of <a href='https://www.youtube.com/@LESSERAFIM_official'>LE SSERAFIM</a>.
Finally, I am an enthusiast of traveling. Some of my highly recommended destinations that I have been to, and possessing profound historical and cultural heritage, include <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangzhou'>Hangzhou</a>, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangzhou'>Yangzhou</a>, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datong'>Datong</a>, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macau'>Macau</a>, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.'>Washington, D.C.</a>, and my hometown <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ningbo/'>Ningbo</a>.
