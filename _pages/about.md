<strong><em>About Me</em></strong>

I am now a second-year <a href='https://ml.gatech.edu/'>Machine Learning</a> Ph.D. student at <a href='https://www.gatech.edu/'>Georgia Institute of Technology</a>, advised by Professors <a href='https://yongxin.ae.gatech.edu/'>Yongxin Chen</a> and <a href='https://mtao8.math.gatech.edu/index.html'>Molei Tao</a>. Previously, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Statistics from the <a href='http://www.math.pku.edu.cn/'>School of Mathematical Sciences</a>, <a href='https://www.pku.edu.cn/'>Peking University</a> in 2023, where I was mentored by Professor <a href='https://zcrabbit.github.io/'>Cheng Zhang</a>. I was born in <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ningbo/'>Ningbo</a>, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhejiang'>Zhejiang</a>, P.R. China in 2001.

My <strong>CV</strong> can be found <a href='https://alexandreguo2001.github.io/assets/cv/Wei_Guo_CV.pdf'>here</a>.

<strong><em>Interests</em></strong>

I am broadly interested in fields ranging from statistics, probability, and machine learning:

<strong>Statistics</strong>: Sampling (Markov Chain Monte Carlo), Computational Statistics, Machine Learning Theory.

<strong>Probability</strong>: Optimal Transport and Gradient Flow Theory, Applied Stochastic Analysis, Statistical Physics.

<strong>Machine Learning</strong>: Generative Modeling, Vision and Language Models.

I am particularly interested in the theoretical analysis of sampling algorithms and diffusion/flow models, as well as developing efficient and scalable algorithms and models for sampling and generative modeling. The focus and goal of my research are two-fold: to reveal the fundamental principles behind the success of data-driven algorithms and to use these insights to develop accessible, efficient, and robust approaches for solving real-world problems that are essential and valuable for our society.

I am also interested in <i>la langue française</i> (the French language), vernaculars of Chinese and minority languages in China, linguistics, political science, <a href="https://www.openrailwaymap.org/">China's railway system</a>, <a href="https://www.flightradar24.com/">civil aviation</a>, architecture, and video games (especially action games such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us"><i>The Last of Us</i></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin%27s_Creed"><i>Assassin's Creed</i></a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_(franchise)"><i>Метро (Metro)</i></a> series). I am also an enthusiast of traveling. Some of my highly recommended destinations possessing profound historical and cultural heritage include <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangzhou'>Hangzhou</a>, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangzhou'>Yangzhou</a>, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datong'>Datong</a>, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macau'>Macau</a>, and my hometown <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ningbo/'>Ningbo</a>.
