<b>About Me</b>

I am now a first-year <a href='https://ml.gatech.edu/'>Machine Learning</a> Ph.D. student at <a href='https://www.gatech.edu/'>Georgia Institute of Technology</a>, supervised by Professor <a href='https://yongxin.ae.gatech.edu/'>Yongxin Chen</a>. Previously, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in statistics from the <a href='http://www.math.pku.edu.cn/'>School of Mathematical Sciences</a>, <a href='https://www.pku.edu.cn/'>Peking University</a> in 2023, where I was mentored by Professor <a href='https://zcrabbit.github.io/'>Cheng Zhang</a>. I am born in <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ningbo/'>Ningbo</a>, Zhejiang Province, China in 2001.

<b>Academic Interests</b>

I am broadly interested in fields ranging from <b>statistics</b>, <b>probability</b>, and <b>machine learning</b>. Please see the <a href='cv/'>CV</a> page for details.

The focus and goal of my research are two-fold: to reveal the fundamental principles behind the success of data-driven algorithms and to use these insights to develop accessible, efficient, and robust approaches for solving real-world problems that are essential and valuable for our society.
