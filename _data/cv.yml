    - I am also interested in <i>la langue fran√ßaise</i> (the French language), vernaculars of Chinese and minority languages in China, <a href="https://www.openrailwaymap.org/">China's railway system</a>, aviation, and video games (especially action games such as <i>The Last of Us</i> and <i>Assassin's Creed</i>). I am an enthusiast of traveling.
