I will attend ICLR 2025 at Singapore to present the conference paper [Provable Benefit of Annealed Langevin Monte Carlo for Non-log-concave Sampling](https://iclr.cc/virtual/2025/poster/29777) and two papers at the [FPI workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/fpiworkshop/): [Fast solvers for discrete diffusion models: Theory and applications of high-order algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00234) and [Complexity Analysis of Normalizing Constant Estimation: from Jarzynski Equality to Annealed Importance Sampling and beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04575). Looking forward to seeing you there!
